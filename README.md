## How to run

## Rules

The game begins with you, the player.

The pieces are jumbled, their purpose unknown. This is a game of strategy, of war, of randomness. No one helps you, no analysis in your hands, play with your friend, they are now your enemy.

## Usage

1. Use the mouse.
2. The player is connected with another player over the internet.
3. The player can see the available moves on the board.
4. The player wins the game by checkmating the other king.
